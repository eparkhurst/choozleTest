# Front End QA Test #

This test is designed to assess your skill at javascript, debugging, writing tests, and refactoring. The code has multiple problems with it, and is written in a very haphazard, script-y way.

### Setup ###

* Install these files in your local environment
* cd into the `server` directory
* Run `node server.js`
* Open your web browser to http://localhost:3000
* The application files all live inside the `public` directory. This is where all of your work will be done.

### What you need to do  ###

* Find bugs on the page and fix them.
* Refactor the code to a more modern way of doing things.
* Modularize and organize the code. Separate concerns. Reuse code where you can.
* Write unit tests to ensure that the JS works as expected. We don't care what you use as a testing package, as long as you document how we can run the tests.

### What you will be judged on ###

* Your code needs to work.
* Your code should be simple to understand. We prefer maintainable over clever.
* The parts should be modularize properly. The more dependencies you can reduce to support reuse, the better.
* The tests should be meaningful and pass.
